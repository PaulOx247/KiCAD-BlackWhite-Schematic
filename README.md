# KiCAD Black-and-White Print Scheme

This repository contains a custom color scheme for KiCAD that allows users to print schematics in black and white. It ensures that all elements of the schematic are clear and readable when printed in monochrome. However, any elements assigned a specific color (e.g., red arrows for current flow) will retain their color in the print, making it flexible for highlighting important parts.

## Features
- Optimized for black-and-white printing.
- Ensures schematic clarity and legibility.
- Retains colors for specifically assigned elements, allowing for custom highlighting.
- Easy to install and apply in KiCAD.
